    <h2>Aries (Mars 21-Apr 19)</h2>
    <p>
      Today, if you don't agree with what the group is doing, Aries, don't feel like you have to join in.
      Maintain your integrity and act with confidence.
      If you're confident about your actions, others will put their confidence in you. Don't feel that you have to compromise your beliefs.

      <br>This could be your lucky day!!! Mercury is in your creative fifth house and lucky and expansive Uranus in your financial sector,
      you could hit on an idea to use your talents to earn some bank.
      With a little hustle and muscle, you could bump yourself into the next income bracket!
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Taurus (Apr 20-May 20) </h2>
    <p>
      Get the rest you need, Taurus. Prevent sickness and maintain full control of your mind and body by making sure you get the proper amount of sleep.
      Your actions today should be methodical.
      Make sure you understand the situation completely before you jump in with both feet.
      <br>People may line up for your sage words of wisdom today, Taurus, but be careful how seriously you take the role of “therapist.” With open-minded Mercury in a dynamic dance with communal Uranus in Taurus, friends, associates and relatives may come crawling out of the woodwork to vent to you and soak up your compassion and good advice. While it’s fine to offer a sympathetic ear and some generically helpful words, you really want to avoid getting embroiled in their problems!
       Get the rest you need, Taurus.
      Prevent sickness and maintain full control of your mind and body by making sure you get the proper amount of sleep.
      Your actions today should be methodical.
      Make sure you understand the situation completely before you jump in with both feet.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Gemini (May 21-June 20)</h2>
    <p>You might feel like hiding out in your cave today—so don’t apologize! Even the outgoing Twin occasionally needs to lay low and recharge those social batteries. And today, as your ruler, breezy Mercurys in your communication corner squares amplifying Uranus in your restful twelfth house, superficial small talk might be the last thing you have energy for. You’ve earned the right to opt out of social engagements when you’re not feeling them. So no guilt for staying in tonight with a great book or to work on a craft project!
    <br>
    Don't poke your nose into other people's business today, Gemini.
    Give others their space and let them work things out for themselves.
    Don't feel like you have to gain the attention of everyone.
    Your actions might be thrown off course by the unexpected.
    Be on the lookout for something wild and bizarre that could be coming your way.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Cancer (June 21-July 22)</h2>
   <p>
     Ask for what you need, Cancer, and you will get it. Don't wait around for the rewards to come to you.
     This is one of those days in which actions speak louder than words.
      Don't expect others to read your mind. If you want something, go after it.
      There may be an element of the unexpected working its way into your day so be on guard.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Leo (July 23-Aug 22)</h2>
    <p>
     Watch the sunrise today, Leo. Open your eyes to the beauty around you and let it inspire you to take action.
     Someone may be trying to throw you a curve ball, so be ready.
     You have a generous heart that you should share freely.
     Your helpful nature will draw others to you and help you skate effortlessly through your day.
     Teach someone a lesson that you know they need to learn.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Virgo (Aug 23-Sep 22)</h2>
    <p>You’d rather have peace than conflict, but under today’s provocative skies, you may have to confront a situation directly. A tense square between your ruler, analytical Mercury, in your subterranean twelfth house and changemaker Uranus will make things uncomfortable enough that you actually WANT to initiate what’s sure to be difficult dialogue. Once you get to the “what’s left to lose?” point, things can only go uphill from there. Discuss! </p>
    Get in touch with a friend you haven't heard from in a while, Virgo.
    Someone is waiting to hear from you. Surprise him or her with an unexpected expression of love.
     Rely on your inner map and don't let others throw you off course. Don't waste time.
      Keep an eye on your goals at all times. Other people play key parts in making this day go smoothly, but don't let them manipulate you.
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Libra (Sep 23-Oct 22)</h2>
    <p>
      Mind your manners, Libra, and open doors that you've never opened before.
         Maintain your principles and integrity as you venture forth into worlds unknown.
         Don't write people off without giving them a fair chance. Don't judge others. Give them an equal amount of respect.
          It may be hard to maintain a solid footing today, but you should try.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Scorpio (Oct 23-Nov 21)</h2>
    <p> Broaden your sphere of influence! If your inner circle is feeling a bit claustrophobic, reach out to a wider audience. Thanks to today’s charged meetup of Mercury in your career corner and experimental Uranus in your partnership zone, you could impress people without even trying, and team up FTW! Lean in to that Scorpio charm and chat people up individually. You won’t need to exaggerate your ideas or what you can bring to the table. Just let the facts speak for themselves.</p>
You may go in many different directions today, Scorpio, so try to stay focused. Spend some time by water, even if it's just your bathtub, and reconnect with your true self. The more you integrate your inner nature with your outer demeanor, the more you will attract the people and situations that can help you in your journey.

    <h2>Capricon (Dec 22-Jan 19)</h2>
    <p>
        You're able to get quite a bit accomplished today, Capricorn, as long as you're the one taking action.
        Don't let other people be in charge.
         Your power may come in energetic, erratic bursts, so use this to your advantage.
         Maintain a level head and you will be able to cut through your day's work like a warm knife through butter.
         Whatever you do, don't give up.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Aquarius (Jan 20-Feb 18)</h2>
    <p> Lead with love today, Aquarius! A warm-and-fuzzy mashup of your co-ruler, spontaneous Uranus, in your sentimental sector
      and expressive Mercury in your partnership sphere can deepen connections with your inner circle.
      <br>
      If you thought you couldn’t get any closer, see what happens if you try!
      Open up and share a story about yourself that lives in the vault. When people see that you have a vulnerable side too,
      they might be even more inclined to speak from THEIR hearts.
        Maintain your integrity, Aquarius.
    </p>

    <h2>Pisces (Feb 19-Mar 20)</h2>
    <p> Friday, August 16, 2019
Got a message you’re dying to put out in the world? Today’s a perfect day!
Free-spirited Uranus in your third house of communication is in cahoots with savvy Mercury in your sixth house of hustle and service. Stop working in a desert and let your talents blossom in front of a wider audience. Post on social media, send an update to everyone on your contact list, maybe boldly broadcast this to a few influencers in your field. The right word at the right time to the right person could be a game-changer!
Unexpected situations may crop up to throw you off course, but don't let them.
Stay on your path and try not to give in to the wild, erratic energy around you.
